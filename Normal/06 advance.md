# Advanced Techniques

-   Using the DI container for A/B testing
-   Switching to another DI container
-   Autofac specific techniques:
    - Property injection
    - Built-in support for Lazy<T>
    - Interception
    - Assembly scanning

## Optional and missing dependencies

- Using Lazy<T>
- Using = null
- Using property injection

## Interception

## Common Use Cases

- Logging: To quickly add rudimentary logging to an application that doesnâ€™t have it

- Exception hiding: Adding a layer to catch and log exceptions, and to strip stack traces to prevent information leakage
